# CS370

For this project, I was given the basic framework to create a Deep Q learning algorithm using Python's Keras module. The pre-written code included the game setup, environmental variables, and the framework that the AI agent would use to interact with the environment. I created the Deep Q learning algorithm, and trained it using the framework.

My approach to coding using AI has been rather different than what I usually use. Generally, I start by experimenting, and try to get an understanding of exactly what the code is doing before I proceed to refine my design. In the case of AI, however, it's not well understood exactly how the code works. I had to be satisfied writing down the algorithms, and experimenting with the numbers to see what effect it had on the AI's behavior. I believe that this highlights a particular problem of using AI; that is, AI is not well enough understood to justify how widely it is used. As a programmer, I believe that it is my responsibility to understand how my code could impact the user, and it concerns me that I might not be able to anticipate the AI's interactions. AI is a great tool, and I have no doubt that it will be an important part of future software development, but I believe that my first response to any programming problem would be to attempt to solve it using traditional code.
